# Legend & Concepts

- _Block scoped_ - A variable that is scoped to the block it is declared in. A block is a set of statements enclosed in curly braces (`{}`) or a single statement (e.g. `if`, `for`, `while`, a callback function, etc).
- _Function scoped_ - A variable that is scoped to the function it is declared in, or the global scope if declared outside of a function.
