# quizzes

quizzes I've made about various topics to review concepts and learn stuff.

- **This is a work in progress** - some quizzes are incomplete and/or have room for improvement.

## Structure

Folders are named after the topic they cover. Each folder contains subfolders for each quiz. Each quiz folder contains a `README.md` file with the quiz questions and a `solutions.md` file with the solutions.
